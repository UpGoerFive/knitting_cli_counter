# Knitting Counter

A command line knitting counter project. The main goal is to practice making Python CLI tools. I'll start with argparse, but this project might branch out into new tools depending on what I want to add in.

This project is unlikely to become the most ideal way to track knitting rows/rounds, as there are many other options out there that don't involve the command line and are available on mobile. However I'd eventually like to see if I can get a count display that works in tmux, so there's that. Another stretch goal would be some sort of general display and control panel, maybe including spotify control if that's something that's possible.
