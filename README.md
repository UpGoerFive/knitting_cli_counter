# Knitting Counter

A command line knitting counter project. Currently uses `tomlkit` for config files and the builtin `json` for project serialization.

## Add in goals
- Textual interface
- support for ubuntu keybindings (I want to display a count in the status bar)
- Test suite, probably using pytest
- Potential refactor into an OOP style

This project is unlikely to become the most ideal way to track knitting rows/rounds, as there are many other options out there that don't involve the command line and are available on mobile.
